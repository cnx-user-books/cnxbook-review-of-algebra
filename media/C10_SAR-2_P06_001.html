<h1> The prime factorization of a whole number</h1>
<p>A problem showing prime factorization of [4410].</p>
<ul>
 <li> Line 1: [3] and [441] are separated by a vertical bar, and there is a horizontal line below [60]. [2] is the smallest prime that divides [60].</li>                                                       
<li> Line 2: [441] when divided by [3] yields [147], which is written below [441] with the digit [3] aligned with the second digit [4] of [441]. The smallest prime divisor of [147] is [3] that is written to the left of [147] and is separated by a vertical bar. There is a horizontal line below [147].</li>
 <li> Line 3: [147] when divided by [3] yields [49], which is written below [147] with the digit [4] aligned with the digit [4] of [147]. The smallest prime divisor of [49] is [7] that is written to the left of [49] and is separated by a vertical bar. There is a horizontal line below [49].</li>                                
<li> Line 4: [49] when divided [7] yields [7], which is written below [49] with the digit [7] aligned with the digit [9] of [49]. The smallest prime divisor of [7] is [7] that is written to the left of [7] and is separated by a vertical bar. There is a horizontal line below [7].</li>
<li> Line 5: [7] when divided by [7] yields [1] written below [7].</li>
