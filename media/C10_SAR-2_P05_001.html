<h1> The prime factorization of a whole number</h1>
<p>A problem showing prime factorization of [60].</p>
<ul>
 <li> Line 1: [2] and [60] are separated by a vertical bar and there is a horizontal line below [60]. [2] is the smallest prime that divides [60].</li>                                                       
<li> Line 2: [60] when divided by [2] yields [30], which is written below [60] with the digit [3] aligned with the digit [0] of [60]. The smallest prime divisor of [30] is [2] that is written to the left of [30] and is separated by a vertical bar. There is a horizontal line below [30].</li>
 <li> Line 3: [30] when divided by [2] yields [15], which is written below [30] with the digit [1] aligned with the digit [0] of [30]. The smallest prime divisor of [15] is [3] that is written to the left of [15] and is separated by a vertical bar. There is a horizontal line below [15].</li>                                
<li> Line 4: [15] when divided [3] yields [5], which is written below [15] with the digit [5] aligned with the digit [5] of [15]. The smallest prime divisor of [5] is [5] that is written to the left of [5] and is separated by a vertical bar. There is a horizontal line below [5].</li>
<li> Line 5: [5] when divided by [5] yields [1] written below [5].</li>
